# Early Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy in Diabetes Patients Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the purpose of identifying retinopathy in medical images. Leveraging deep learning techniques to accurately classify retinal images, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment. <br>

## Project Description
The existing methods for detecting and grading Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) often rely on subjective assessments and extensive manual labor, leading to inefficiencies and potential inconsistencies in diagnosis. The increasing prevalence of diabetes and the limited availability of ophthalmologists further exacerbate the challenges in timely screening and diagnosis. Therefore, there is a need to develop a robust and reliable automated system that can accurately detect and grade diabetic retinopathy, enabling early intervention and personalized treatment plans.
This project aims to address this challenges by leveraging machine learning and computer vision techniques. The proposed system will take fundus images of the retina as input and automatically detect the presence of diabetic retinopathy. The system will also grade the severity of the condition, providing clinicians with valuable information for treatment planning. <br>
